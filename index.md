### Fraud Detection Model for US

Fraud detection is a set of processes and analyses that allow businesses to identify and prevent unauthorized financial activity. This can include fraudulent credit card transactions, identify theft, cyber hacking, insurance scams, and more.

### Investment prediction

This is just a collection of topics and algorithms that in my opinion are interesting.

It contains several topics that are not so popular nowadays, but that can be very powerful. Usually, topics such as PDE methods, LÃ©vy processes, Fourier methods or Kalman filter are not very popular among practitioners, who prefers to work with more standard tools.
The aim of these notebooks is to present these interesting topics, by showing their practical application through an interactive python implementation.

### Language Translation using NLP

(https://github.com/ravikantydv/FreelancingProjects/tree/39bef55407121f0ff7c4454672a3e256882c72e1/Language%20Translation%20(NLP%20%26%20Transformers))

The following article sections will briefly touch on LSTM neuron cells, give a toy example of predicting a sine wave then walk through the application to a stochastic time series. The article assumes a basic working knowledge of simple deep neural networks.
